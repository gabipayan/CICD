	• ✅  Automated Testing: The GitHub Action runs Cypress component tests automatically on every pull request.
	• ✅ Deployment to Render: Once the tests pass, and the code is merged into the main branch, a GitHub Action triggers an automatic deployment to Render.
	• ✅ GitHub Action Integration: All actions are integrated using GitHub Actions, providing visibility into test results and the deployment pipeline.
